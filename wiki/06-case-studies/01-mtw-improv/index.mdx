# MTW Improv in Avon

## Sound

Below documents the **sound** setup that I used for 3 MTW Improv shows in [Avon drama studio](/wiki/04-spaces/03-avon.md) in the 23/24 academic year.
I found no systemic issues with the band monitor making the room too loud.
I had no big problems with feedback due to this setup.
I also found no issues while working with the band in terms of scope-creep due to giving them a vocal and band channel to their own monitor mixer.
Your milage may vary and of course when you're on the show its up to you to design the setup, this is all just what worked for me and my opinion!

### PA 

For main PA, use two LVX on their stands at the front, placed out of the way of: the performance space, the whiteboard, and the band.

### Band Monitoring 

To provide the band monitoring, use the [MTW active sound desk](https://usa.yamaha.com/news_events/2002/20020117_yamaha-emx5000-series-mixers-just-add-speakers_us.html) to drive their passive speaker stored in the avon cupboard.
These just need 13A power, as the mixer has a built-in amp that can drive the speaker!
To send things out the band monitor, first route them out the SQ5 stagebox, and provide them as inputs to the MTW mixer.
Make a mix with all the vocal channels post fade, then make a second mix with all the band channels pre fade.
Send these mixes down the ethercon cable to 2 outputs on stagebox in the band pit.
This allows the band control over making the vocals the right level, which eliminates the biggest complaint from the band i.e. not being able to hear cast.

Band will normally be keys, bass, guitar, drums.
