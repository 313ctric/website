# Arrivals Stage 2024


In July 2024, we responded to [Residential Community Team](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/rescommunity/rct/) email about their Arrivals week stage. We offered to provide tech and operators for the event for them. Warwick Presents organised the hire of a [Stage Tech ST130 5x5x6m stage](https://www.stagetecheventhire.co.uk/small-trailer-stage.html), which we rigged with basically all of our lights and speakers.


## Sound 

This was the first proper usage of the [Tech Crew Line array](https://www.nexo-sa.com/products/geo-s1210/). Either side of the stage, we vertically stacked 4 segments of line array on top of hired [SU  subs](https://emacoustics.co.uk/docs/products/s-215/). 
During the get in, we noticed there were weird phasing and interference issues right near the barrier. To fix this we used 2 of our LVX-8 speakers as front fill which seemed to fix the issue. 
We used the last surviving [big mackie](https://mackie.com/en/products/loudspeakers/srm-portable/SRM450.html) as a center foldback, and the two [small mackies](https://mackie.com/en/products/loudspeakers/srm-portable/SRM350.html) as left and right foldbacks.
We ran sound from the SQ5 + stagebox, using our phones/ipad as monitor mixers using mixpad.

## Lighting

We utilised the tech crew lights including 2 lumipars, 6 cobs, 7 battens and 2 festoons (with two bulbs broken in get in). We also hired in 2 robe spikies and 2 chauvet q wash (that definately didnt break) from the SU. 
The cobs were placed across the back as backlights, flanked by 2 battens clamped to the pillars either side. 
On the middle bar we had the q washes before they mysteriously stopped working, before replacing them with the spikies once we actually got power cables for them for the SU. 
We used two lumipars as facelights, did a proscenium arch that was made eintirely out of festoon and had the remaining 3 battens placed at the front of the stage facing into the audience. 
To control the lighting we used the tech crew Zeroflx desk that also could control the hazer and bubble machine through the use of a dimmer rack. All but 1 fader on the desk was in use at some point during the arrivals stage.
