# Arrivals Stage 2024


In July 2024, we responded to [Residential Community Team](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/rescommunity/rct/) email about their Arrivals week stage. We offered to provide tech and operators for the event for them. Warwick Presents organised the hire of a [Stage Tech ST130 5x5x6m stage](https://www.stagetecheventhire.co.uk/small-trailer-stage.html), which we rigged with basically all of our lights and speakers.


## Sound 

This was the first proper usage of the [Tech Crew Line array](https://www.nexo-sa.com/products/geo-s1210/). Either side of the stage, we vertically stacked 4 segments of line array on top of hired [SU  subs](https://emacoustics.co.uk/docs/products/s-215/). 
During the get in, we noticed there were weird phasing and interference issues right near the barrier. To fix this we used 2 of our LVX-8 speakers as front fill which seemed to fix the issue. 
We used the last surviving [big mackie](https://mackie.com/en/products/loudspeakers/srm-portable/SRM450.html) as a center foldback, and the two [small mackies](https://mackie.com/en/products/loudspeakers/srm-portable/SRM350.html) as left and right foldbacks.
We ran sound from the SQ5 + stagebox, using our phones/ipad as monitor mixers using mixpad.
