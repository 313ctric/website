# Tech Crew

Tech Crew is one of the many [Warwick SU Societies](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/techcrew/),
with a purpose of providing technical theatre training and opportunities for students at the University of Warwick.

Apart from socials and trainings, most of our activity is determined other groups and societies (especially those in
[Warwick Drama](/wiki/warwick-drama)) who require technical support for their
[shows and events](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-and-hires). This provides quite a lot of flexibility and variety in the work
that we do, with members being able to get involved with as much or as little as they wish.
