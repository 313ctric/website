# Storage

As part of [Drama Collective](../warwick-drama), Tech Crew shares the two storage locations on campus - the DC 
Cupboard and the Avon Cupboard. In the Warwick Arts Centre, Tech Crew also has access to the dock, COSHH cupboard and 
under-stairs cupboard.

## Warwick Arts Centre Storage
The Warwick Arts Centre is the main building that Tech Crew is based in, as it where all the shows take place. It is,
however, also a professional touring venue with regular events, so it is important to be respectful of staff and 
other users of the space at all times.

All of our storage locations are in a closed-off area known as 'Back of House' (BOH), which is only accessible via a 
code which changes every week. This code is given on a need-to-know-basis by the exec, such as when you are on a show.

### The DC Cupboard
The Drama Collective (DC) Cupboard is our main storage area, located on a balcony in the dock. Whilst we share this 
with other societies in Warwick Drama, Tech Crew has its own dedicated area of the space where we keep all of our 
equipment.

During a show get-in or get-out the door to this will often be left unlocked. Otherwise, the code to this is only 
known by the exec or by the DC Cupboard Manager.

### The Under-Stairs Cupboard
The under-stairs cupboard is a small cupboard which is (shockingly) under the stairs to get to the DC Cupboard. This 
stores some of our speakers and [Percy](./flight-cases), our production flight case. Similarly to the DC cupboard, 
this is left open during a show but otherwise is only accessible to the exec.

### The Dock
The dock is a large, open area which is managed by Phil, Senior Head of Workshop at Warwick Arts Centre. This is 
mainly used for the Arts Centre's own storage (you may be asked to get their equipment from here if you're working 
on a show), however we also have a few large set pieces here from previous shows (such as a random lamp post!).

During a show, we can use this space (with prior arrangement from Phil) to store and paint set - however there may 
be many other shows going on, so it is important to be respectful and keep it tidy.

### The COSHH Cupboard

COSHH stands for Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations and includes materials such as paint, 
Flamebar and isopropyl alcohol. These are kept in a bright yellow, locked cupboard inside Phil's workshop, which is 
the taped off area in the dock.

If you require access to the COSHH cupboard (for example if you are painting set for a show), you may ask the exec 
for the code. Please make sure that you have read the
[Tech Crew Dock & COSHH Cupboard Guidance Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AcdqaJpShk4jQxCUUjZx8MoNIsk50tnC/view?usp=sharing).

## The Avon Cupboard

The Avon cupboard is the DC's secondary storage location on the Westwood Campus. Tech Crew often keep a few large 
stands here for easy access for hires, but otherwise we don't really use this cupboard.

The code to this cupboard is only known by the exec or by the DC Cupboard Manager.
