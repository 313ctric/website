# Finance

As part of Warwick SU, Tech Crew has a society account and must follow all the
[SU regulations](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/exec-resources/finance/guidelines/). Sometimes finance 
can get a little complicated - please don't hesitate to reach out to the Treasurer if you need any assistance.

## Money Request Forms (MRFs)

Money Request Forms are the way to request money from the society account. For most purchases, it is easiest to 
first purchase the item using your own funds (ensuring to obtain and keep a receipt) and then 'request' this to be 
paid bank in a bank transfer.

### Submitting an MRF

:::info
Requesting money back from a show? Generally, these MRFs should be made to the society behind the show, and not Tech 
Crew, otherwise these may be rejected by the SU.
