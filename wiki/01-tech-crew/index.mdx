# Tech Crew Wiki

Welcome to the Tech Crew wiki! This serves as a central location for explaining how we work and providing useful
information to anyone interested in taking part in a show or hire. You can use this wiki by browsing through
*Next*/*Previous* options at the bottom of the page, flicking through the sidebar or using the search tool - do whatever
works best for you! Please also don't feel to obliged to read or remember everything, as often things are learnt best by
doing them!

This wiki is still a work in progress, and everyone is welcome to contribute - even if you've only just joined the
society! You can edit the content by clicking the *Edit this page* link at the bottom of each page or by going directly
to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WarwickTechCrew/website). Alternatively, you can send a message on the
Discord and someone else can handle the more technical part.
