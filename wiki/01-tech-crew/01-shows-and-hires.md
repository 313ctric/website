# Shows and Hires

Apart from trainings and socials, all of Tech Crew's activities are divided into shows and hires. These all work on
a project basis, with members applying to roles on each project using our internal system
[AdamRMS](https://dash.adam-rms.com/).

* **Shows** are larger projects in the Warwick Arts Centre with a partnering [drama society](../warwick-drama).
  These are a more standard process with set roles and often require a longer commitment (often a full show week and
  prior planning and meetings).
* **Hires** are projects where a society or group request tech and (a) tech operator(s) for their own event. These
  can be much more varied but are often on a much smaller scale, such as providing a few lights on a stand. These
  are typically a much shorter commitment (e.g. just an evening or weekend) but can be in locations other than the
  Arts Centre.

## Special Events

While _technically_ hires, this category contains larger scale events that require an amount of preparation and
involvement closer to shows. They often involve hiring equipment from elsewhere, and are good fun from a tech
perspective without necessarily requiring the huge ongoing time commitment shows can have.

Events in this category include [WSAF](/wiki/case-studies/wsaf-2024.md) and Pride.
