# Flight Cases

We use flight cases to transport equipment between different venues, and also own a production flight case which is 
brought out for shows or large hires.

## Percy
Percy is our production flight case, which is stored [under the stairs leading up to the DC cupboard](./storage). Percy 
contains:
* LX tape
* Tools
* Torches and headtorches
* Batteries
* Gobos

## Gibby (he/him)

## Flo (she/her)

## Dave [the box] (he/him)

## Boris (she/they)

Boris is a cable trunk but has never seen active use with cables. For many years she sat dormant with old 15 and 16amp cables that were entirely unused, as well as an ominous "needs testing/fixing" cables section. In the 2023 maintenance week, it was decided that they would be more useful as a generic case for dumping random stuff in, and the dividers were removed, with the hope that she would see active service (as there was an expectation that we would be able to use a forklift on a regular basis)

Boris should probably be used as a cable trunk for events like WSAF (it would have been so helpful in 2024), however the primary issue is she doesn't fit down the stairs, so the only way to transport her is by forklift off the edge of the cupboard, which is not trivial to organise. As such they have remained dormant, taking up space in the cupboard but being a really convenient movable seat/workbench.

Uses for Boris:

- Putting cables in
- Putting stuff there isn't another place for in
- Dreaming about being able to use a forklift to use them
- Cutting gels on
- Sitting on
- Getting stuck in a doorway
