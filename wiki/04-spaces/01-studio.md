WAC Provides a 360 view of all its venues, on the [WAC website](https://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/our-venues/studio/)

## Seating

<!-- ![studio levels](/images/studio/studio-levels.jpg) -->

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
  <img src="/images/studio/studio-levels.jpg" alt="Image 1" style={{ width: '45%' }} />
  <img src="/images/studio/seating_plan.jpg" alt="Image 2" style={{ width: '45%' }} />
</div>


You can view the [seating plan](https://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/download/file/THFUeFg2QkJSQUVseW41UDJpU3dBdz09/) via the information from WAC's website.

The seats in the back row can be taken out in sets of 3. You'll have to take out 6 seats to make space for the sound mixing desk, these are called the "front of house holds".

Rows A to D are made up of three columns of removable bleachers. These can be taken out of the venue and stored in the dock, allowing for shows in the round or having the audience stand i.e. for music gigs.

## Studio CAD

### Section View

The public drive has a [CAD file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14TwSrr7mwapPVbPDDN8Pqs9k-5upM8-4/view?usp=drive_link) of the studio, which can be uploaded to this [online CAD viewer](https://viewer.autodesk.com/) so you can inspect and measure the space yourself.
