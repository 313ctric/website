## Seating 

The raked seating detail represents the minimum capacity in a standard end-on configuration, comprising four tiered rows of 19 seats (A at the front - D at the back) and one flat floor row of 19 seats (AA). There are a further 57 fixed seats (row E) on the Auditorium Balcony level of which six each side are generally held off sale for reasons of sight lines. 

The seats in the back row can be taken out in sets of 3. The mixing desk + chair takes up about 5 seats worth of room. So you'll have to take out 6 seats (because they come in sets of 3) and then add an extra chair such that the net taken out seats is 5.   

Rows A to D are made up of three columns of removable bleachers. These can be taken out of the venue and stored in the dock, allowing for shows in the round or having the audience stand i.e. for music gigs.
