# WAC Theatre
The WAC Theatre is our largest performance space, seating up to 575 people. In term 2, we will typically have a show 
here by Warwick Opera and Music Theatre Warwick.

## Layout & Seating

### 360 Camera View
The WAC provides a 360 view of all its venues on its
[website](https://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/our-venues/studio/).

</div>

## Working in the Space

As with any venue in the Warwick Arts Centre, it is important to be mindful and respectful of other users. For those
working on a show, the studio can be accessed via Back of House - the code to access this changes weekly and can be
given on request to Tech Crew exec.

When getting out, please follow the WAC's
[get out checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V3--hqdy2GujzzLPbnORoPKkkl1umAva/view?usp=sharing).


## Technical Specifications
### Patch Panels

A [list of all the patch panel numbers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1me_DVrEaxsSUcurCd-MGxp_9FndEu_dc/view?usp=sharing)
can be found on the wall in the sound control room, next to the patching rack. Make sure to make a note of the patching
before changing anything, so this can be reverted during the get-out.

![Patch Panel Numbering](sound-patch-panel-numbering.jpg)

When patching, use the black patch cables stored on the ducting next to the rack. Red patch cables should never be
touched (where possible) - if you need to change these, make sure to revert them back during the get-out.

Note that unless patched, patches with a red label will automatically link to the matching red label patch below it.

Commonly used patch panels are:
