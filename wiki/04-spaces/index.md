# Spaces

These are the venues we normally work in!

WAC Studio and Theatre are hired out for use by the DC, MTW, and OpWa, see: [the wiki page about WAC show slots](warwick-drama/shows#wac-show-slots).
The WAC hire fee takes up a large portion of the show budget! So for smaller independent shows, and for our hires, we use venues around warwick outside of WAC.

## Centrally Timetabled Rooms

To book a performance space, log into the [Web Room Booking System](https://warwick.ac.uk/roombooking)
with your Uni ID (`uXXXXXXX` where the `X`'s are your ID number) and your Warwick ITS password.

:::warning

You're only allowed to perform in certain rooms, due to noise limits. See: [Performance Rooms](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sg/spa/centraltimetabling/roominformation/alternativevenues) for a full list.
