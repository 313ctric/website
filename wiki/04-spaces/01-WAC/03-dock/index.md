# Dock

## COSHH Cupboard

In the dock, we have a locked metal cupboard for [Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/).

### What is COSHH?

The law requires you to adequately control exposure to materials in the workplace that cause ill health. 
To comply with these regulations, we have a locked metal cabinet in the dock that stores hazardous materials (flammables, chemicals, paints ect) alongside their datasheets.

### What does this mean practically?

Hazardous materials need to be stored in an appropriate location (the COSHH cupboard), the content of which is logged each month by WAC staff (Phil). A hazardous material will have a red diamond with a pictogram of the hazard inside. Everything in the COSHH cupboard should have a proper data listing content. Safety is everyoneâ€™s responsibility.

:::warning

The bottom of the cupboard is a drip tray and cannot have things stored there!
The bottom shelf **must** be kept clear.

### Who is Phil?

Phil is the Head of Scenic Workshop in WAC and builds the student sets. He oversees cleanliness and organisation of the workshop and the dock. Contact and liaise with Phil about your use of the dock, and what equipment youâ€™re planning to store/leave there.

### What do we stock in the COSHH cupboard?

If any stock is low, please inform Tech Crew Exec.
Here is the information in a markdown table format:

| Item       | Purpose/Notes    |
|---------|------|
| Air Duster                                | For air dustingâ€¦ and clearing out mics when sweated out.    |
| Label Remover                             | Good for removing tape from mic cables and cleaning cables, need to soak. |
| Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol)       | Removing sharpie from case labels (this has an invisible flame). |
| Paints                                    | Tech Crew stock white and black coats, other paints are bought for shows specifically and should be labelled with which show and dates of purchase. Where possible, water-based, non-aerosolised paints should be chosen. When mixed, some paints will never dry â€“ ask before you buy if unsure. Some paints are designed to be watered down â€“ again, ask if unsure. White paint is often used as an undercoat, with the final colour being applied as a second layer. If you mix colours, remember to keep track of what ratio you used, incase you need more of that colour later! |
| N5 Flamebar                               | Used for wood and wood products (paper, cardboard, etc.). |
| PE6 Flamebar                              | Used for natural and synthetic materials (cotton, linen, muslin, wool, etc.).  |
| Flamebar flame retardants application     | Can be applied by dipping, spraying, padding, or brushing. Use the solution as supplied or dilute with water according to data sheet or preferably by test. Flame retardancy is long-lasting, but if you wash what you flamebared, you should reapply another layer. |
| Paint Brushes, Rollers, Trays, Spray Bottles | Tech Crew stock of painting and Flamebar supplies. The contents are for everyone to use, so clean them once youâ€™re finished. If there are issues, contact Tech Crew Exec. |


### Is it free?

No, the consumables in the COSHH cupboard are not free. Some contents of the cupboard might be for other shows so check with Tech Crew Exec before you use something thatâ€™s already in there (and label what is for your show). We donâ€™t make profit on consumables; the cost is passed onto the show as transparently as we can.



### Guidance for working in the dock

- The Ops Assistant is on duty to deal with building operations and are the person who locks up at the end of the day, they might start asking you to leave around 9pm. 
- The area outside the yellow and black striped tape must be clear when you leave
- If there are other shows in the Studio or Theatre, you might not be able to use the dock due to a load in/out.
- Even if they arenâ€™t loading in or out, respect how close you are to the venues and dock equipment with noise and belongings
- Paint! â€“ Once youâ€™re finished painting, use the paint sink provided (under the DC cupboard) to wash brushes, rollers, and trays
- If you have a palette still full of paint that you want to keep fresh for tomorrow, cover it with clingfilm, to stop it drying out.
- If you have set with wet paint, leave a note
- Once your show is in the venue, clear out the dock of everything for your show and relabel extra paints for other show use
- You must confirm with Phil exactly what equipment you are planning to leave in the dock during show week, this must be arranged before your show week!
