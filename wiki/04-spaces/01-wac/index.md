# Warwick Arts Centre
The Warwick Arts Centre is the main building that Tech Crew is based in, as it where all the shows take place. It is,
however, also a professional touring venue with regular events, so it is important to be respectful of staff and other
users of the space at all times.

All of our storage locations are in a closed-off area known as 'Back of House' (BOH), which is only accessible via a
code which changes every week. This code is given on a need-to-know-basis by the exec, such as when you are on a show.
