# Equipment Directory

Sources for various equipment Tech Crew doesn't have!

## On Campus

### Warwick SU Tech Services

We often work with SU tech services on special events, as they have a lot of equipment more suited for live events that
we don't have. Similarly, they regularly rent our radio mics.

* Big PA
* Moving lights
* **Staging (LiteDeck, with 1ft or 3ft legs)**
* ATEM Mini Pro ISO
* Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K

### AV Services

The University's AV services offer a range of equipment to borrow
[on their website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/av/bbav/equipment), most of which isn't very
releavant to Tech Crew on a regular basis.

However, they do sometimes have other kit to borrow on request, and can be especially helpful for hires and conferences
in centrally timetabled rooms (such as WES) where they can provide additional mics and equipment, as well as direct
access to the rooms' hard patching to save running cables everywhere.

### IT Services

Can offer setting up networking and patching ports for internet access around campus (including outdoors) if emailed
with enough notice.

### Estates

Can offer power hookups and assorted distribution in various outdoor locations around campus, and sometimes generators
too when needed if you're lucky.

### Warwick Arts Centre

Obviously in regular use for shows, they can sometimes offer equipment hire outside the WAC if asked nicely.

### Event Production (Warwick Conferences)

The department that does the tech for Warwick Conferences has a good range of equipment. We've used one of their sound
desks (they have a range of A&H SQ series desks with Dante) for a training before, and I'm sure they'd be willing to
hire other equipment if asked nicely like the WAC.

## Hire Companies

### Marklew Productions

We regularly use Marklew Productions for hiring Ayrton Ghibli moving heads for shows, but they have a big range of tech
for dry hire. If you say you're from Tech Crew hiring things for a student event they usually give a great price!

### IPS

One of the big national hire companies, based in Milton Keynes. We've used them for an event or two, their particular
strength is having a great website with a full list of equipment and prices. The delivery and collection price can be
fairly brutal though for the quanities of equipment we use, so this is best if there's a car available to drive there.

## Societies

### RaW (Radio at Warwick)

If you're looking to organise video for an event, RaW are the society to contact. They have a good stock of cameras and
 things inherited from the defunct Warwick TV when it merged into RaW visual, and are willing to collaborate on
events too. Relevant equipment includes:

* 4 or 5 ENG style camcorders
* ATEM Mini Pro ISO
* Lots of HDMI cables
* Heavy-duty video tripods
* Some unspecified lapel radio mics

### UWCS (CompSoc)

UWCS have video stuff aimed at livestreaming talks and their annual WASD speedrunning event. Stock includes:

* ATEM Mini Pro ISO (yes, there's a good few of these around)
* Panasonic Lumix GH5
* RÃ˜DE Wireless GO II radio mics (2 transmitters)
* Behringer XR-18 digital mixer

### CU (Christian Union)

The CU have weekly services with live music, and have assorted equipment to support this that can be useful:

* Music and instrument stands
* A pair of Sennheiser XSW handheld radio mics
* SRM 350v3 PA

### TEDx

Like UWCS, TEDx have some video equipment for recording their events - of particular note is their Blackmagic Pocket
Cinema Camera 4K (they might buy more in the future too)!
