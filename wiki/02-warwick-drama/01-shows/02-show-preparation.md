# Show Preparation

## Tech Read-Through

This is the initial sit-down meeting between the production team and the tech. It involves going through the script page by page, penciling in each place the prod team would like a cue. This will probably be the first time you get your script, exiting! The meeting usualy involves the designers and core prod team, so: LX designer, Sound designer, Techical Manager, Producers, Director, and optionally: Music director, Video designer, DSM, ect.

## WAC Meetings

Email Amanda/ Phil @ WAC! Touch base about your thoughts on design. They have a wealth of knowledge about past student shows, and will be more than happy to offer their knowledge + experience. 


## The Rider

Example of a good rider: [Fame Rider](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXT3K8aHHhs3Dm2CXeaUoXPVI5146VoZ?usp=drive_link)

## Paper Tech

This is where the tech team runs through the script telling the DSM where the designers want to be cued. The DSM will mark up their script in pencil for the first time here.

:::warning 

Paper tech and tech read are different things!
