# Lighting (LX)

There is a guide on being and LD for a WAC show
[in the guides section](wiki/05-additional-resources/01-guides/how-to-ld.md)

## Gels

Gels are thin transparent coloured film that are placed in front of a light source to colour the light. Lights with gels are called "practical" lights, to distinguish them from other coloured light sources such as LED's. You'll need to find the LX cutting board (it has useful size guides) and a stanley knife to cut these into squares for your lights.

Gels are also used by sound designers! The [RAT music stands](https://www.ratstands.com/product/shop-opera-stand/) (music stands with lights) are often too bright, so we gel them with a light blue colour. This makes their apperance less harsh while still allowing musicians to read their sheet music.

## Gobos
Gobos are thin metal plates with designs cut into them. They are put in front of spotlights to project that image onto the set.
