them!

## Cable Lengths
Warwick Tech Crew label all cable lengths with coloured tape on each end of the cable - this uses the same colour scheme
as the Warwick Arts Centre for simplicity.

* 5m: Blue
* 10m: Red
* 15m: Blue and Red

## Cable Ownership
Warwick Tech Crew cable can often be identified through a Tech Crew asset tag (starting with TC), or from the coloured
tape indicating the cable length.

When working in Warwick Arts Centre, it can be very difficult to identify what cable is Tech Crew's and what cable is 
the WAC's. In most cases, cables should have an asset tag from the relevant organisation. When working on shows, it is
highly recommend to **only** use WAC cable where possible, apart from IEC power cables for Tech Crew equipment -
this helps make it easier to sort cables after a get-out.
