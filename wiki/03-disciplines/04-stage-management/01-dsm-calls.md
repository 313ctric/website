## Calls

Back of House calls are always 5 minutes ahead of actual time - e.g. the 'half' call is given 35 minutes before the
show is supposed to open, not half an hour.

| Minutes Before Show Start | Front of House Calls | Back of House Calls |

| 35m                       |                      | Half Call           |
