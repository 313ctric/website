# Radio Mic System Proposal 2024

Tech Crew is planning to purchase a new 8-channel Sennheiser EW-DX radio mic system before the start of the 
2024/2025 academic year for the cost of Â£9,500. This is due to our current system, the Sennheiser EW300 G3, 
starting to become less reliable due to being 14 years old (with an expected lifespan of 10 years).

:::info
As of 09/08/2024, the Tech Crew Exec have unanimously voted to go ahead with this radio mic purchase. As it stands,
this purchase will be made before the start of Term 1 2024, but everyone is welcome to look at our thought process and
ask any questions.
:::

## The System

The new system will be an 8-channel [EW-DX](https://www.sennheiser.com/en-gb/product-families/ew-dx-professional) EM 4
Dante Sennheiser system. This uses 3-pin LEMO connectors instead of our existing 3.5mm jack connectors, which should
be more reliable and less prone to damage. Out of our 12 existing MKE2 lavalier microphones, 7 will be reterminated to
the 3-pin LEMO. We will additionally purchase 5 new MKE Essential microphones with a 3-pin LEMO connector, totalling 
12 lavalier microphones and 8 channels.

The new radio mic system will consist of the following:
* 2x [Sennheiser EW-DX EM4 Dante Receivers](https://www.sennheiser.com/en-gb/catalog/products/wireless-systems/ew-dx-em-4-dante/ew-dx-em-4-dante-q1-9-509370)
  (4 channels each, totalling 8): 2x Â£2,400
* 8x [Sennheiser EW-DX SK 3-Pin LEMO Bodypack Transmitters](https://www.sennheiser.com/en-gb/catalog/products/wireless-systems/ew-dx-sk-3-pin/ew-dx-sk-3-pin-q1-9-509398):
  8x Â£400
* 5x Sennheiser MKE Essential Microphones (3-pin LEMO connector): 5x Â£193
* 7x MKE2 Retermination from 3.5mm to 3-Pin LEMO: 7x Â£55
* Radio Mic Rack Patch Panels (XLR, Powercon, Antenna, Ethernet): 1x Â£125
* Sennheiser Wave Dipole Antenna Rod: 1x Â£25
* **Transmitter/Receiver Total: Â£8,000**
* **Grand Total: Â£9,500**

### Current System
The current system is an 8-channel Sennheiser EW300 G3 system, which was purchased in 2010:
* Currently 8 channels with a theoretical maxiumum of 12 and realistic maximum of 10.
* Fully analogue
* Uses the unreliable 3.5mm jack connector
* Uses fixed antennas that are complex or expensive to replace
* Not water resistant in any way
* Needs a 6u flight case rack which is bulky and heavy
  * Takes up 1u of rack space per 2 channels
  * Needs the use of a distribution amplifier

### Alternatives

We have considered the following alternatives:
* Shure ULX-D: ULXD4, ULXD4D, ULXD4Q
* Sennheiser EW-DX: EW-DX EM2, EW-DX EM2 DANTE, EW-DX EM 4 DANTE

A full feature comparison can be provided upon request, but in general Sennheiser was chosen over Shure because:
* It is a newer system so likely to be in support for longer
* It has better documentation
* Lower latency (1.9ms)
* Cheaper
* Longer battery life
* Full metal construction of the receivers
* Daily chain networking, so no switch is required
* Better e-ink displays for transmitters

## Why Now?

Tech Crew have been discussing the purchase of a new radio mic system for the past few years as we've been aware of our
current system slowly becoming less reliable and requiring more repairs. The current system was purchased in 2010, with
an expected lifespan of 10 years.



## Finance

The cost of the system will be covered by our existing Tech Crew reserves and hopefully partially from a grant from the
SU (although this is not guaranteed). We have enough reserves to safely purchase this in full without being in danger of
not being able to pay for other expenses or having enough reserves for repairs or floats in shows - this is mainly due
to us having saved up for this purchase over the past few years, and due to the success of recent shows and larger 
hires.

We will likely need to increase the price of hiring the radio mic system for hires and shows, however this should not be
too much of an extra expense and still needs to be finalised.
