# Sound at Improv Fringe

:::info
The following is a sound info pack made by Freya for The Improv Musical at Fringe 2023. Although some parts have
changed since then (e.g. the mics used), it is still generally a useful guide.
:::

## Morning Meeting/Before You Leave
* The morning meeting is the chance to let prod team/cast and/or band know of any problems, requests or changes 
  you might be making to the show that day (E.g. if the host is not using the handheld mic correctly it's a chance to 
  remind them of proper mic etiquette).
* The directors will give notes to tech - make note of and apply anything that is doable, make them aware of 
  anything you physically will not be able to achieve 
* Take mic numbers 
  * This is done by the cast calling out the mic numbers they had yesterday, anyone who did not perform
    yesterday will take the mic of whoever they are replacing
  * Make sure you note this down somewhere - it is very important to have later 
* Make sure you have with youâ€¦
  * The sound lanyard
  * AT LEAST one roll of mic tape
  * Glue
  * Adhesive remover
  * Wipes to clean mics
  * AT LEAST two battery bays
    * You do not need the charging port

## Pre-Show
* After the meeting on the steps is the best time to clean mics, you may find another time between shows to do this 
  that works better for you but using the time the cast are changing in is the least likely to cut into your
  personal/free time
  * The Patterhoose Bar is a good place to go for this
  * You will need to find an FOH manager to let you into the storage cupboard where the flight case is placed
* As soon as you have cast on the upper landing you can start mic-ing them - even if it's before the schedule says
  * We often get let into the space earlier than our allotted time as the show before us has a quick get out, mic-ing 
    the cast up earlier may mean they hang around mic'ed for a few minutes, but it means you can get started as soon 
    as you get into the space

## Mic-ing Up/15 Minute Get-in
As soon as you get into the space head to the sound desk and change the scene to our scene
  * Press the â€˜scene memoryâ€™ button on the top left of the desk
  * Use the scrolling wheel to move to the â€˜improvâ€™ file
  * Use the arrows above the scrolling wheel to navigate down to the â€˜recallâ€™ button
  * Use the â€˜enterâ€™ button to the lower left of scrolling wheel
* Cable the mic receives to the desk (sometimes the resident staff do this for us but dont rely on them)
  * The snakes are labelled â€˜1-4â€™ and â€˜5-8â€™ for ease but do check they are ours - they are the only ones back
there with the little coloured tags
  * They go onto the top layer of XLR ports on the back of the deks with the rightmost port being channel 1
and the numbers working across to the left
* Start mic-ing up the cast
  * Call the cast up to the sound desk in their number order (just makes it easiest to track who you have done) and 
    add their mic pack (not forget to put batteries in them!)
* Make sure there are batteries in the hand held (this is provided by the space and should be on the desk) and that 
  it is turned on
* Start sound checking the cast while the band are finishing up
  * Feel free to call out cast members that are not projecting sufficiently
  * Donâ€™t forget about the host
* Once the band are finished setting up do a band sound check and make sure all DIed instruments are making noise 
  and that hey are happy with their monitor mix

## Potential Problems Checklist
Cast mics not working:
* Check the fader is at a sensible level (about -10/-5DB for talking)
* Check you are adjusting the fader on the correct level
  * The â€˜1-16â€™ button should be on for FOH, the â€˜mix 1â€™ or â€˜mix 2â€™ buttons should be
* Check the channel isn't muted
  * The â€˜ONâ€™ button should have a red light on it
* Check there is a green light above the channel on the desk to show it is getting noise
* Check the master fader is on and at a sensible level
* Check the receiver is orange (means its connected)
* Check there are levels coming through the receiver
* Check the gain is at a normal level (most are sat around the -1 to +1 level
  * Play with turing the gain up to see if that does anything - if this works but your gain has to be crazy high 
    then check to make sure the mic pack hasn't had its sensitivity turned way down)
* Check the correct XLRs are plugged into the correct ports
  * Working right to left on the back of the desk
    * 1=brown
    * 2=red
    * 3=orange
    * 4=yellow
    * 5=brown
    * 6=red
    * 7=orange
    * 8=yellow
  * On the back of the receivers it goes ports 1-8 from left to right
  * E.g. the brown, left most port on the back of the receiver should be connected to the brown tagged
cable in the â€˜1-4â€™ snake and be connected into the right most XLR port on the back of the desk, which is behind channel 1
* Check the mic pack is on and has batteries in

Band mics not working:
* Check the fader is at a sensible level (about -10/-5DB for talking)
* Check the channel isn't muted
  * The â€˜ONâ€™ button should have a red light on it
* Check there is a green light above the channel on the desk to show it is getting noise
* Check the master fader is on and at a sensible level
* Check with band that the cables are plugged in correctly
  * Keys - cable 3
  * Bass - cable 4
  * Kick - cable 5
  * Guitar - cable 7
* Check the gain is at a normal level (most are sat around the -1 to +1 level
  * Play with turing the gain up to see if that does anything - if this works but your gain has to be crazy high 
    then check to make sure the mic pack hasn't had its sensitivity turned way down)
* Check any amp is turned on and working
* Check any mic is on and working

If monitors are low
heck all instruments are coming through FOH
  * This way you know if it's the instrument overall of just the foldback
* Check the DI boxes/amps are on
* Check if the monitors have been turned off by accident
* Check the monitors are plugged in at the wall
* Check the monitor mixes are coming out of the speakers you are expecting them to (sometimes the monitors get
switched)
  * If they have been switched then the band will be getting the monitor mix with only the cast vocals and not
their own instruments
* Check monitor masters are up on the masters layer

## EQing
Most EQing is done on the HA dial, the grey top left dial on the right hand side panel of the desk
  * This will change the digital HA dial on the screen of the desk
  * Changing the HA is only going to increase or decrease the volume of the noise - e.g. if someone has a
very powerful voice and is louder than the previous person on the mic you can turn down their HA
* If you need to remove specific frequencies from a mic (e.g. in the case of a hissing on the mic or potential
feedback) use the physical dials labelled â€œhigh, medium high, medium and lowâ€™ to select which section you want to 
  edit, then the matching 'frequency' dial to select (visible on its counterparty on the screen, not the dial itself)
  the frequency you want to eliminate, then finally the â€˜gainâ€™ dial to reduce the level of the frequency
  * This will change the green graph on the screen to ensure it has done what you expect

## Get-out
Mute all channels as soon as the band finish so that no unpleasant noises happen when the band start de-rigging
* Collect all mics of the cast
  * They mostly take them off themselves, but you may have to help, especially if someone has been glued
* Remove batteries from mic packs and ensure they are all back in their charging bays and in your bag ready to go 
  back to the flat
* Coil and store mics as per usual
* Lock mic case and ensure it's ready to be loaded into the storage cupboard
* If you have had to make any serious changes to the set-up/EQ etc., use the arrows to navigate to the scene menu as 
  if you were recalling a scene, but click save instead of recall, then do the same with the sound USB so that your 
  new file is on there too
* Unplug the XLRs from the back of the desk but do not plug anything else back in
* Ensure you have the handheld back on the desk
* If you have time, change the desk to the show file of the next show, it helps out the resident staff
* Assist the band, prod team of LD if there is anything they need
* After you leave, find the FOH manager of the building, so they can let you into the cupboard
