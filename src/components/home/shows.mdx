## [Shows](/shows)

We mainly operate in Warwick Arts Centre, a professional touring venue with a [550-seat theatre](/wiki/spaces/theatre)
and a [black box studio](/wiki/spaces/studio). We work with [societies](/wiki/warwick-drama) such as the Drama
Collective, Music Theatre Warwick and Opera Warwick to put on several productions each term, with roles including
[lighting design](/wiki/disciplines/lighting), [sound design](/wiki/disciplines/sound),
[set design](/wiki/disciplines/set) and [stage management](/wiki/disciplines/stage).

Shows are a well-structured and often multi-term [process](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows), with Tech Crew members
joining production teams from the initial planning stages before ['panel'](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows/panel) until the
end of [show week](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows/show-week). These are typically a more involved process, but
can be more rewarding than hires as there is a bigger opportunity for realising your own designs in a commercial
arts venue.

Previous shows include Company (Music Theatre Warwick, 2024, WAC Theatre), Carmen (Warwick Opera, 2024, WAC
Theatre), A Streetcar Named Desire (Warwick University Drama Society, 2024, WAC Studio) and The Tempest
(Shakesoc x Warwick University Drama Society, 2024, WAC Studio). A full list can be found on the [Show Archive](/shows).
