## Shows

We mainly operate in Warwick Arts Centre, a professional touring venue with a 550-seat theatre and a black box theatre.
We work with societies such as the Drama Collective, Music Theatre Warwick and Opera Warwick to put on several
productions each term, with roles including lighting design, sound design, set design and stage management.
