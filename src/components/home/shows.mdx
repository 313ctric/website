## Shows

We mainly operate in Warwick Arts Centre, a professional touring venue with a 550-seat theatre and a black box theatre.
We work with societies such as the Drama Collective, Music Theatre Warwick and Opera Warwick to put on several
productions each term, with roles including lighting design, sound design, set design and stage management.

Shows are a well-structured and often multi-term process, with Tech Crew members joining production teams from the
initial planning stages before 'panel' until the end of show week. These are typically a more involved process, but
can be more rewarding than hires as there is a bigger opportunity for realising your own designs in a commercial
arts venue.

Previous shows include Company (Music Theatre Warwick, 2024, WAC Theatre), Carmen (Warwick Opera, 2024, WAC
Theatre), A Streetcar Named Desire (Warwick University Drama Society, 2024, WAC Studio) and The Tempest
(Shakesoc x Warwick University Drama Society, 2024, WAC Studio). A full list can be found on the Show Archive.
