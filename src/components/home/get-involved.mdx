## Get Involved

To get involved with our events and join the society, please purchase membership from the Warwick Students Union website - this covers insurance, so it is essential that you purchase this before you can setup or operate our equipment or work in some of our spaces.

We operate over Discord and on a hire/show project basis - so you can get involved as much or as little as you wish. We also offer socials and training opportunities throughout the year, which are also advertised on Discord. Please read our Getting Involved wiki page for more information.
