## Hires

Tech Crew offers a hire service to societies and groups at Warwick to help bring their events to life. We own a variety
of technical equipment which is available as a ‘dry’ hire (we simply give the equipment to you), or with the support of
some of our members to set up and run (a ‘wet’ hire).

Our inventory includes sound equipment (PA, speakers, wired and wireless microphones and mixing desks), lighting
equipment (lights and lighting desks) and associated cables and consumables, and we’re able to arrange external hires
if we don’t own something that you’re looking for.

Please read our wiki or contact hires@warwicktechcrew.co.uk for more information. Once you’re ready to contact us about
your event, please fill in the Hires Request Form.
