## Hires

Tech Crew offers a [hire service](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-and-hires) to societies and groups at Warwick to help bring
their events to life. We own a variety of technical equipment which is available as a ‘dry’ hire (we simply give the
equipment to you), or with the support of some of our members to set up and run (a ‘wet’ hire).

Our inventory includes sound equipment (PA, speakers, wired and wireless microphones and mixing desks), lighting
equipment (lights and lighting desks) and associated cables and consumables, and we’re able to arrange external hires
if we don’t own something that you’re looking for.

Please read our [wiki](/wiki/tech-crew) or contact hires@warwicktechcrew.co.uk for more information.
Once you’re ready to contact us about your event, please fill in the
[Hires Request Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__mfC2PNUMjRJTTRVOU5aQVBFTkZDN08zQ0hESUdSVy4u).
