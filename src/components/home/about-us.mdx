## About Us

Warwick Tech Crew is the society for anyone interested in technical
theatre or entertainment. We work with many societies and groups across
the University of Warwick to help put on many shows and events
throughout the year - these range from small hires involving a
couple microphones, to large student productions in the Warwick Arts
Centre theatre, to campus-wide outdoor festivals featuring over 50
performances.
